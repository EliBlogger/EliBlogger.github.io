    <td>This term, we have been working on coding and encoding messages on google sheets. At the start of the term, I didn't have a clue on how to use google sheets. My target was to learn how to successfully code within sheets, as I was already quite good at coding python, but wanted to get better at other coding programmes.</td>

    <td>I have learnt how to create a code, by using a keyword code. Once we had made our code, we had to learn how to use some programming techniques, such as vlookup, where the computer looks through the columns you have told it to look in and it tries to find the letters that you have entered.

Another skill that we learnt in week two was how to concatenate the coded text, which then enabled us to decode it. This part of the coding enabled us to not have to type out our code word for word, which would take a long time and would also make sure we don’t make any mistakes.

A third thing that we learnt was how to use the iferror command. This made sure that if there was an error that didn’t seriously affect the code, for instance if there was a space in your message, it would just show as blank, instead of a "REF!".

A final important piece of coding that we learnt was using the right and left commands, which told the programme which letters to pick in the long list of letters that had been coded.</td>

    <td>I very often didn’t understand something that our teacher said, and sometimes didn’t tell him, so for parts of my lessons I just sat there trying and failing to figure out what to do when I could have just asked him and that would have saved me lots of time over this month and then maybe I would have done better at the end.</td>
