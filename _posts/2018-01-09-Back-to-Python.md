    <td>This lesson, we were looking at how to use loops, lists and 'append.' When studying loops, we were mainly working out whether to use a ‘for’ loop, or a ‘while’ loop. Using lists, we were trying to be able to print a single part of the list in a program. Append was when when we attempted to edit a list without changing the variable.</td>
