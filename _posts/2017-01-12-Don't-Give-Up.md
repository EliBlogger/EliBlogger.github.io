    <td>In this IT lesson, we mainly listened to Mr Keen. We were talking about how lots of people try to find shortcuts in learning, and try to cheat. He was saying that we should try to learn as much as possible in every task that we were set, never give up, and that cheating (like copying and pasting) never really gets you anywhere. He then showed us an amazing clip of a Japanese kid who fails at a vault 4 times, but his teacher made him try the vault again, and again until he made it!</td>

    <td>I sometimes found myself drifting out of concentration, which was a shame. This is because the things that we learn are quite useful, so I don't want to not know them.</td>

    <td>I will put my hand up more, so Iâ€™m constantly engaged in the conversation and can listen to what Mr Keen is saying to the best of my ability.</td>
