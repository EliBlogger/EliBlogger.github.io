    <td>In today's IT lesson, we carried on with CodeAcademy. Some people didn't have tables on their blogs, so that's what they had to fix while we were coding! In this lesson there wasn't much talking being done by Mr Keen- we just got on with the task by ourselves, asking our friends for help if we needed it.</td>

    <td>From time to time, I found myself chatting with my friends, instead of always focusing on what I need to do which is what Mr Keen expects.</td>

    <td>I will try to talk a lot less, so that way I can probably progress very far in the course very quickly.</td>
