    <td>Getting quickly through the CodeAcademy course</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To get through at least 5% more of the course, not 10% as usual- the course is now lots harder.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes- by the end of the lesson, I was up to 61%, which is a whole course higher than I was at the start of the lesson.</td>

    <td>This lesson involved lots of things going wrong- I forgot to put a colon at the end of for loops and functions quite a lot, meaning the programme told me I had a 'syntax error'. I didn’t know what that meant until I realised it meant I’d forgotten a colon.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should’ve asked earlier what a syntax error meant, as I spent most of the lesson trying to work out what it did mean.</td>
