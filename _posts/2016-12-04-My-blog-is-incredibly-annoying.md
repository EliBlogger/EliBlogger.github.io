**_What we did_**

**In today's IT lesson, we had the choice between working on our blogs, or carrying on with our fusebox coding work. I chose to fix my blog, because my style.scss file was completely and utterly broken. I spent the whole lesson trying to fix it, with both of my teachers’ help. I didn’t know it at the time, but by the end of the lesson my style file was fixed. However, I didn’t know it, because my background was appearing, but it had shrunk. This was because… the picture was too small!!! In future, I think that I might check to see how big the picture is when I copy the link!**

**_WWW_**

**By the end of the lesson, my blog was fully functioning, and I managed to change the background effectively at home!**

**_EBI_**

**I think that if I had remained calm throughout the WHOLE lesson, then I would've been able to make my blog even better! This means that my target for next lesson is to not panic, and get fustrated.**
