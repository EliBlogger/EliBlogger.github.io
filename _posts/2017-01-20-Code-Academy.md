    <td>In this IT lesson (1 day before Trump becomes U.S presidentâ€¦) we were introduced to a website called CodeAcademy. CodeAcademy is a quick, effective way of learning languages of code- the language that we're learning is called Python. I had already done a bit of CodeAcademy work in year 7, but had forgotten most of it, so had to start from the beginning. Our Raspberry Pi work from last term really helped me understand how Python works though!</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Every so often, I skipped the part that told me what the code I was entering would do, and go straight on to the instructions. This made writing out the code a lot more difficult.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because of my failure to read all of the text, my target for next lesson is to read every single bit of the text allocated to the task that I'm working on, NOT just skipping to the instructions.</td>
