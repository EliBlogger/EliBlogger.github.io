    <td>We're back from the holidays! In this lesson, we were learning about how computers process numbers- they do this using a counting system called binary. I was pleased that I was able to understand most of the information that Mr Keen was telling us, and didn't seem to find myself wandering out of concentration like I sometimes do.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Every so often when I didn't understand something, I tried for a few minutes to fully understand what Mr Keen had just said. This time that I took to think left me behind, because after I knew what Mr Keen meant, he was talking about something else.</td>

    <td>Target:</td>

    <td>Because I was left behind when I didn't understand something, instead of taking a long time to work it out for myself, I'm going to put my hand up and ask Mr Keen questions more.</td>
