    <td>This lesson we started looking at functions. Functions are a block of reusable code that is designed to perform a specific function, hence the name. At the start of the lesson, we played around with functions by making calculators. By the end of the lesson, we had made a card picker, which used functions to randomly pick a card and tell it to the user.</td>
