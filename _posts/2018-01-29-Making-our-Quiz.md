    <td>This lesson we started the programming for our Buzzfeed quiz. My quiz is about what kind of dog you are. The logic behind the programming for the quiz is to start off by creating a list that contains many lists inside it. The lists inside the list are my questions and options. That is as far as I got this lesson, however there is a lot more to be done, such as creating a for loop so as to print only one question at a time. If you want to see what happens when I run my code, go to the bottom of this post. My current problem is that when I press run, my programme prints all of the questions and all of the answers in one big 'chunk'.</td>
