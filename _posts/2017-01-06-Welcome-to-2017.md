**_What We Did_**

**Today was the first IT lesson back from the Christmas Holidays (which were really good), and the first thing we did was swap teachers! Today was a very different lesson to the ones we had last year, as we were taught about binary numbers, which is how a computer counts. It does this by asking questions. E.g. is there a one? After this question, if you are trying to ask what 1+1 is, then the computer would say yes, and then repeat the question and answer to find what 1+1 is. **

**It was a fun, interesting lesson, and I learnt lots of useful things about how computers can add together numbers, and how computers store numbers.**

**_EBI_**

**If I had understood what was going on earlier, then I would have learnt a bit more, so my target to myself is to ask more questions when I don't fully understand something. **
