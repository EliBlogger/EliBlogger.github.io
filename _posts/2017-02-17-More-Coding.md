    <td>In this lesson, we were carrying on with CodeAcademy. I'd progressed quite far last lesson, but I wanted to do a bit more this lesson. I finished the functions course for homework, and this lesson, I also finished planning a holiday using python!</td>

    <td>This lesson, I focused really well, and although I chatted to my friends a bit, I was still getting through lots of the course- I don't think that very much limited my learning.</td>
