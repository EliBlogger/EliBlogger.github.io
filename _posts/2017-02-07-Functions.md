    <td>In this lesson, we were carrying on with CodeAcademy. I'd progressed quite far last lesson, but I wanted to do a bit more this lesson. I finished the PydginLatin translator (pydginlatin is a strange language, which changes words in a strange way!) and had moved on to a course called Functions, which involved finding the square root of numbers! A good lesson.</td>
