**_What we did_**

Hello again! In today's lesson, we spent most of the time listening to Mr Keen & Mr Tansley talk to us about the mark scheme for our blogs. I don't know if he'll like mine, but I hope all of you do! Everyone knows that most lectures are boring, but this one was pretty good and gave us lots of tips on how to improve our blogs, like changing our font colour and background colour, and we also marked a few of my classmates blogs! All in all it was a good lesson.

I can't really do a WWW and EBI for this lesson, because we didn't really do any activities, so instead I'll set myself a target for my blog.

**Target:** to improve my blog, I need to change the colour on my background (I think white's fine, but as white is the default background setting, I need to change it so Mr Tansley can see that I'm confident with using technology) and possibly tweak a few presentation settings like using tables to encase my writing.
