**_What We Did_**

In this lesson, I decided to try to make my blog look better, by using tables and containers! I triedâ€¦ and failed for quite a long time. First, I made a table on my google doc, so that's what my blog would look like on my blog. However, you have to change some settings on your style.scss file to actually make the text look like a table, which I found quite complicated, so I'll leave that for the time being.

**_WWW_**

In this lesson, I worked through all of my options, and realised when I needed to stop trying, and did stop!

**_EBI_**

If I'd had a bit more time, then I probably could've been able to put in containers and tables, so my target for next lesson is to manage my time a bit better.
